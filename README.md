Password Generator (Module Three)

For this module I created a password generator that kept the same color styles as my previous portfolio site.
I used javascript to essentially create the password generation, using html and css I was able to get it to look the way I pleased.
The site can generate passwords using letters, numbers, and symbols.
Ranging anywhere from 4-32 characters, you can change this using the slider provided when you load the page. 
Once generated a simple click of a button will copy your password to the clipboard.
